Feed Module
==========

This is a fork of https://github.com/jonleighton/bcms_feeds which updates the module to work with BrowserCMS 3.5.x and later. It will be released as bcms_feeds_bmedia since the original gem is owned by jonleighton.

Overview
========

This is a BrowserCMS module which fetches, caches and displays RSS/Atom feeds.

For installation instructions see http://www.browsercms.org/doc/guides/html/installing_modules.html

To incorporate a feed in your page, use a Feed Portlet. Specify the URL of the feed. SimpleRSS [http://simple-rss.rubyforge.org/] is used for parsing, and a parsed version of the feed will be available in the @feed variable. You can use the code section to manipulate this data as necessary, and the template to format it.

Feeds are cached in the database for 30 minutes. If there is a failure fetching a remote feed, the expiry time of the cached feed will be extended by 10 minutes. When fetching remote feeds, the timeout length is 10 seconds.
